# Multi-stage, multi-arch build. The builder runs on the native build platform
# and cross-compiles the static binary for the target platform (CGO disabled), so
# no QEMU emulation is needed; the distroless runtime stage only copies the
# binary. The runtime image is distroless static, non-root, with CA certificates
# for HTTPS FortiGate endpoints.
#
# Base images are pinned by multi-arch manifest-list digest (the tag remains as
# human-readable context); Dependabot's docker ecosystem keeps the digests fresh.
